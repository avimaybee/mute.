# Product Guidelines: Mute

## Visual Aesthetic: "Invisible Chaos"
- **Minimalist Realism:** The application and its notifications must look and feel like standard system components. Avoid "weird" or "pranky" visual cues. 
- **The "Real" Illusion:** Notifications should use genuine-sounding sender names and structures to blend in perfectly with the user's other alerts until the content is read.
- **Typography:** Use clean, system-standard sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto). 
- **Logo:** A single, simple, and consistent logo used across all touchpoints to maintain a professional (yet mysterious) brand identity.

## Communication & Voice
- **Dynamic Personality:** The voice shifts between three core modes to keep the user off-balance:
    - **Deadpan & Sarcastic:** Dry, minimalist roasts about phone habits.
    - **Philosophical & Absurd:** Weird, "out-of-left-field" observations.
    - **Chaotic & Meta:** Self-aware commentary on digital fatigue and the app's own existence.
- **Genuine Tone:** Despite the absurd content, the delivery must sound "real" and "genuine," as if a legitimate system process or person is speaking.
- **Typographic Voice:** No character mascot. The personality is defined entirely by the words and their placement.

## User Experience: The Punchline
- **The Hook:** The notification itself is the setup. It should be indistinguishable from a real alert at first glance.
- **The "Gotcha!" Screen:** Upon tapping a notification, the user is met with a stark, high-contrast, minimalist screen. The focus is purely on the text—bold, clean typography delivering the punchline.
- **Minimal Friction:** Ensure the app feels lightweight. No unnecessary animations or "internet ugly" clutter.

## Design Constraints
- **System Integration:** UI elements should mimic Android system components (Material 3) to enhance the illusion of being a core part of the OS.
- **Accessibility:** Maintain high contrast and readability. The minimalism must serve usability, even while being chaotic in spirit.
