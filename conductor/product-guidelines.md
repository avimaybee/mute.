# Product Guidelines: Mute

## Visual Aesthetic: "Obsidian Executive"
- **Swiss Modern / High-Fashion:** Rigorous grids, bold typography (Roboto), and cinematic minimalism using "Interactive Depth" (glassmorphism).
- **Dark Mode First:** Palette relies on deep blacks (`#0A0A0A`) and charcoals (`#1A1A1A`) with striking accents of Platinum (`#E0E0E0`) and Mute Orange (`#FF4500`).
- **Typography:** Uses "Roboto" with stylistic tracking (wide letter spacing) for a premium, machine-like feel.
- **Motion:** Fluid, staggered reveals with 60fps interpolators. Subtle haptic feedback accompanies all transitions.

## Communication & Voice
- **Dynamic Personality:** The voice shifts between three core modes to keep the user off-balance:
    - **Deadpan & Sarcastic:** Dry, minimalist roasts about phone habits.
    - **Philosophical & Absurd:** Weird, "out-of-left-field" observations.
    - **Chaotic & Meta:** Self-aware commentary on digital fatigue and the app's own existence.
- **Genuine Tone:** Despite the absurd content, the delivery must sound "real" and "genuine," as if a legitimate system process or person is speaking.
- **Typographic Voice:** No character mascot. The personality is defined entirely by the words and their placement.

## User Experience: The Punchline
- **The Hook:** The notification itself is the setup. It should be indistinguishable from a real alert at first glance.
- **The "Gotcha!" Screen:** Upon tapping a notification, the user is met with a stark, high-contrast, minimalist screen. The focus is purely on the text—bold, clean typography delivering the punchline.
- **Minimal Friction:** Ensure the app feels lightweight. No unnecessary animations or "internet ugly" clutter.

## Design Constraints
- **System Integration:** UI elements should mimic Android system components (Material 3) but elevate them ("High Fashion").
- **Edge-to-Edge:** No ActionBars. The experience must be immersive.
- **User Control:** "Master Toggle" must always be accessible to disarm the system. Transparency (Logs) is key to trust.
- **Accessibility:** Maintain high contrast and readability. The minimalism must serve usability, even while being chaotic in spirit.
